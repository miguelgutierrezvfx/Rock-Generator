# Rock Generator

This HDA allows you to easily generate lots of different types of rocks.

Download the .hda file and put it in your otls directory (on Windows, that's usually \Documents\houdinixx.x\otls). Launch Houdini and the HDA should appear in the TAB Menu under the name Procedural Rocks Generator.
